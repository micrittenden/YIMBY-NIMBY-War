# YIMBY-NIMBY-War
An early prototype of a game set in a Spectra Cities block. The player (3rd-person controller) runs around using keyboard inputs collecting tokens and food while being chased by "NIMBYs". Built in Unity 2021.3LTS.
*Note that the "market block" asset used in this prototype was not yet optimized for gaming, so it has millions too many polys.
